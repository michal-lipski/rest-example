Java REST example
=================

Description
-----------

Very basic example about how to develop a REST web application with Jersey [1]_,
Jetty [2]_, Maven [3]_ and Spring [4]_.

Jersey is the open source JAX-RS (JSR 311) [5]_ Reference Implementation for
building RESTful Web services.

With this example you could check how to develop REST web services in a web
application. Different methods in your application will be called depending on
the HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT or DELETE.

This is based in a post by Tim Reardon in his blog:
http://blog.reardonsoftware.com/2009/03/jersey-jetty-and-maven-helloworld.html

This example has been developed using GNU/Linux and it is not tested in other
operative systems.

In order to launch the web application you should use the next command from the
main folder::

  $ mvn jetty:run

Then you could go to the next URL with your browser to check if it works:
http://localhost:8080/java-rest-example/rest/helloworld

Moreover, you could use the examples at `scripts` folder to check if it works::

  $ cd scripts/
  $ get.sh
  $ post.sh message.xml
  $ put.sh 1 message.xml
  $ delete.sh 1


Requirements
------------

* Java 1.6
* Maven 2
